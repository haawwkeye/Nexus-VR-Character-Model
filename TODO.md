## Better Walking

For example instead of automatically turning I want you to just be running into the wall<br>
I have no idea where/how to change this

## Virual Keyboard

I want to make the keyboard better, It currently does work but it could be better<br>
For example some keys are still "selected" even tho they shouldn't be<br>
Aswell as general issues that I want to fix

## Better Building

I want to have building automated in something like a "stable" branch<br>
Basically when "dev" is ready to be switched to stable we can just merge it into "stable"<br>
I can probably use the Cloud API to auto update the module aswell if I do it correctly<br>
I also want to make the build something other than .bat but for now that works

## Nothing else for now

I can't think of anything else for now besides looking into the FootPlanter and other stuff
since we have the new VR API stuff
