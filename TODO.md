## Better Walking

This might be a roblox thing so for now I won't look into it<br>
~~For example instead of automatically turning I want you to just be running into the wall<br>
I have no idea where/how to change this~~

## Virual Keyboard

I want to make the keyboard better, It currently does work but it could be better<br>
For example some keys are still "selected" even tho they shouldn't be<br>
Aswell as general issues that I want to fix

## Better Building

I want to have building automated in something like a "stable" branch<br>
Basically when "dev" is ready to be switched to stable we can just merge it into "stable"<br>
I can probably use the Cloud API to auto update the module aswell if I do it correctly<br>
I also want to make the build something other than .bat but for now that works

## Menu Tutorial

Maybe make a simple popup that shows you how to enter the menu??<br>
Kinda like R6Message but with an image(s) showing how to enter the menu

## Add support to new Chat

I have no idea if it currently works on the new chat or not<br>
But if it doesn't I want to add support for the new system<br>
Maybe just make a Custom Chat UI and for the keyboard<br>
It should be fine besides updating the function that sends chat messages

## Nothing else for now

I can't think of anything else for now besides looking into the FootPlanter and other stuff<br>
~~since we have the new VR API stuff~~<br>
Turns out you cannot access the player height yet?<br>
I attempted and realized it's RobloxScriptSecurity so...<br>
Won't do that for now
